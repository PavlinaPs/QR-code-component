## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

When adding the image in the layout I realized that there are two ways how to do it. In HTML file as an \<img> or in css file as background-image. I decided to add it in HTML this time and wrap in a \<div> because of the flexbox. 

I also realized I need to check the layout on a big screen - I work on a notebook. Lesson learned from previous challenge (Interactive rating component). I found this page: https://bluetree.ai/screenfly/ where I can check it and it seems to do the job.

### Continued development

I want to be more concise and code faster and I am going to work on that.
